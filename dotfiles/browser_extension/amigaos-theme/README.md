## Installation

1. Open Brave/Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select this `amigaos-theme` folder

## Features

- Classic AmigaOS gray color scheme for browser UI
- Works on tabs, toolbar, and browser frame
- Complements the Simple Color Replacer extension for complete AmigaOS look

- Text: Black (#000000)
- URL bar: Light gray (#c0c2c0)
- Tab separators and borders: Dark gray/black

## Where to Find It

After installation, the theme won't appear in `brave://extensions` (this is normal for themes).
You can see and manage it in `brave://settings/appearance`

## Compatibility

Works with:
- Brave
- Chrome

- Edge
- Any Chromium-based browser

Does NOT work with Firefox (Firefox uses a different theme API).

## Limitations
